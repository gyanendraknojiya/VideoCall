Introducing a Video Call App, a web-based communication tool that allows users to make video calls using only a user id. The app is built with React and Node.js, which ensures a fast and responsive user experience.

The app utilizes WebRTC and Web Socket technology to ensure high-quality video and audio, with low latency and real-time communication. The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a simple call button and no login required. Users can initiate a call by entering the user id of the person they wish to call, and the app will connect them automatically.

The app also features a ringtone to indicate an incoming call, and a screen share function that allows users to share their screen during a call. Additionally, the app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) which ensures fast loading times and offline functionality.

Whether you're working remotely, keeping in touch with friends and family, or conducting a business meeting, Video Call App is the perfect tool for real-time communication.
